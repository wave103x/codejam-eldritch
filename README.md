### Shuffle rules:
There are three types of cards with three difficuties each: *green*, *brown*, *blue* and **easy, normal, hard** respectively.
- Easy cards with snowflakes
- Hard ones with tentales
- Normal ones without any decorations

### First step

- **Effortless**. Maximum of easy cards for each color.
- **Easy**. Without hard cards.
- **Normal**. No manipulation with deck complexity.
- **Hard**. Without easy cards.
- **Harder Than Hard**. Maximum of hard cards.
